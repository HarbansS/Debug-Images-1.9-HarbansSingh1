## The challenge

##  Debug: Missing Image
Someone has submitted a bug report on this web page. Can you fix the bug?

# What I expected to happen	?
# What happened instead

## Add alt to Existing Images
The alt attribute is short for alternative text. As you may have seen on web pages that do not load properly, alt text appears to describe the image that is not rendering.

# Do This
Read the HTML and look at where images are used.
Add a descriptive alt attribute to each image.
# Add Image Link
A gymnastics image has already been uploaded for you. The next step is to link it to the web page.

# Do This
Add an image link for the image "gymnast.gif".
