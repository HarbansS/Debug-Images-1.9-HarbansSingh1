## How do we place images in a HTML document? 


"**The image tag** allows you to add images to your page. You might notice that this tag looks a little different than those you've seen before. Unlike paragraph, header, or list tags, the image tag doesn't require a closing tag. All of the information needed to display your image is contained within the tag itself.

**Image Source and Alternate Text**
In order to tell the browser which file to use, extra information, called an attribute, is added to the image tag inside the brackets. The attribute src stands for source and tells the name of the image, and the attribute alt describes the image.


**Create an image tag using the abbreviation img**. This is considered a self closing tag, since it doesn't need to wrap text as many other tags do.
**The src attribute** is short for source. This tells the tag which image to load. In this case, the page will look for an image with the filename dog.jpg in the same directory as the page. Image file names include extensions that tell the computer which type of image they are working with. Common extensions are .jpg, .jpeg, and .png. Make sure to put quotation marks around your image filename.
**The alt attribute **is short for alternative text. While you won't see this text on your web page, it provides a backup in case your image doesn't download properly or for visually impaired users. In this example, if your browser failed to load the image you would see 
# FAQ
1. Why does an image tag not have a closing tag?
An image tag doesn't need a closing tag because there is no text content that must be wrapped in tags. The content that shows on the screen is specified through the tag attributes.
2. What is an attribute?
Attributes are extra information included in a tag. Attributes have names and values. The name tells what type of information is being provided and then the value gives the specific information for that tag.
For example ```<img>``` tags have two attributes, src and alt. The src attribute specifies the name of the image file and alt tells the browser in readable text what the image is.
